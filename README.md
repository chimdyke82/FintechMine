- My Name is Chimdike. I am an Engineer. I have a degree in Production Engineering and an MSc in Petroleum Engineering.
- I see myself spinning away from core oil and gas industry to playing in the Tech space as a project manager
- I felt i would have the best of worlds - have an insight into what is happening in Tech, coding, understand the vocabulary, cryptocurrency and the processes involved. Tittu has coached me.
